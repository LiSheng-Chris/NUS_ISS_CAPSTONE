## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Cancer detection has always been a major issue for thepathologists and medical practitioners for diagnosis and treat-ment planning. The manual identification of cancer from mi-croscopic biopsy images is subjective in nature and may varyfrom expert to expert depending on their expertise and otherfactors which include lack of specific and accurate quantita-tive measures to classify the biopsy images as normal or can-cerous one.  The automated identification of cancerous cellsfrom microscopic biopsy images helps in alleviating. As partof this practice module project, we aim to provide a systemto automate the identification of the cancerous cells from mi-croscopic biopsy images which can be used by doctors andpathologist for early detection and treatment.  We have pro-posed a method of segmentation and classification techniquebased on the features and utilized Unet model for segmenta-tion, mobileNet for gleason grading.
